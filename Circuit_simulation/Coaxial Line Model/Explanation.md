That is an excellent and crucial question. The dramatic drop in phase margin is the entire reason for the instability, and it highlights the fundamental difference between a simple load and a transmission line.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of why the coaxial cable causes the phase margin to collapse:

### 1. What Determines Phase Margin?

First, let's recall what phase margin is. In a feedback system, we analyze the **Loop Gain**, which is the total gain going around the feedback loop. For the op-amp in a unity-gain configuration, the loop gain is:

`Loop Gain (s) = A_v(s) * β(s)`

*   `A_v(s)` is the op-amp's internal open-loop gain. Its phase drops from 0° to -90° at the first pole, and heads towards -180° at the second pole.
*   `β(s)` is the feedback factor. For a voltage follower, this is determined by the voltage divider formed by the op-amp's output resistance (`R_out`) and the load impedance (`Z_load`):
    `β(s) = Z_load(s) / (R_out + Z_load(s))`

**Phase Margin** is measured at the frequency where the loop gain's *magnitude* is 1 (or 0 dB). It is the difference between the loop gain's *phase* at that frequency and -180°.

`Phase Margin = 180° + Phase_of_Loop_Gain`

For the system to be stable, we need a healthy phase margin (typically > 45°). A phase margin near 0° means the system is on the verge of oscillation.

### 2. The Load Impedance (`Z_load`) is the Culprit

The op-amp itself has a predictable phase response. The instability comes from the unpredictable behavior of `Z_load` when that load is a transmission line.

*   **Scenario A (Simple Load):** When the load is a simple 2 pF capacitor, its impedance `Z_load = 1 / (s * C)` has a constant phase of **-90°**. The op-amp is designed and compensated to handle this predictable phase shift. The loop gain's phase rolls off smoothly, and we get the expected 65° phase margin.

*   **Scenario B (Coaxial Cable):** A transmission line is **not** a simple load. Its input impedance (`Z_in`, which is our `Z_load`) depends on its length, its characteristic impedance (Z₀), and the load at the *far end* (the oscilloscope).

Due to wave propagation and reflection, the input impedance of the cable varies wildly with frequency. At certain frequencies, the reflected wave from the far end arrives back at the op-amp's output in a way that causes destructive interference.

Specifically, when the cable's length is an odd multiple of a quarter-wavelength (λ/4, 3λ/4, etc.), a **high impedance** at the far end (like the 1 MΩ scope input) is transformed into a **very low impedance** at the input.

This creates sharp, resonant dips and peaks in the impedance magnitude, and more importantly, **causes huge, rapid shifts in the impedance's phase.**

### 3. How This Destroys the Phase Margin (Connecting to the Plots)

Let's look at **"Plot 1: Loop Gain Analysis"** for the green curve (Scenario B):

1.  **Magnitude Plot (Top):** You can see sharp, deep notches in the magnitude response starting around 20-30 MHz. This is the transmission line's impedance resonance.
2.  **Phase Plot (Bottom):** Look at what happens to the phase at those same frequencies. Instead of continuing a smooth, gentle rollout towards -180°, the phase **plummets and swings wildly**. Each resonant notch in the magnitude corresponds to a massive phase shift in the phase plot.
3.  **The Critical Point:** The op-amp's unity-gain frequency (where the magnitude curve crosses 0 dB) happens to fall right in this region of wild phase shifts. At the 0 dB crossover frequency (around 7-8 MHz), the phase of the loop gain has already been dragged down to almost -170°.

`Phase Margin = 180° + (-170.2°) = 9.8°`

The transmission line has introduced a huge, unexpected phase lag into the feedback factor `β(s)` right where it hurts most, effectively erasing the stability margin the op-amp was designed to have.

### Conclusion: The Analogy

Imagine pushing a child on a swing.
*   **Simple Load:** Pushing a swing directly is predictable. You time your pushes to be in phase with the swing's motion. This is stable.
*   **Coax Load:** Now imagine pushing the swing by using a long, floppy spring. When you push, a compression wave travels down the spring, reflects off the swing, and comes back to your hands. The timing of this returning wave can be completely out of sync with your next push, kicking back against you. This is the extra, unpredictable phase shift introduced by the transmission line. The op-amp gets "confused" by these unexpected phase shifts from the load and becomes unstable.

The source follower (Scenario C) fixes this by **isolating** the op-amp. The op-amp now sees only the tiny, simple `C_gs` of the FET (a predictable load), while the robust, low-output-impedance source follower is left to handle the difficult job of driving the "floppy spring" of the coaxial cable.
