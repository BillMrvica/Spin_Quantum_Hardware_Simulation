This repository contains the datasets and the analysis scripts used for the  manuscript 'Operating semiconductor quantum processors with hopping spins' of C. Wang et al.
The repository is created in Febr 2024 by Chien-An Wang and Francesco Borsoi at TU Delft, and then updated on May 2024.
This note describes on how to obtain the figures related to the part of the manuscript discussing the results of the 3-4-3 array, i.e. the 10 quantum dots array.

Each folder in this repo contains sub-folders that create an article figure.

The folder 'utils' contains 4 relevant files for starting the data analysing.  For the execution of this code, start from running this file:

-- packages_style_database_with_file_importer.py: 
is the start-up script, by running each cell, we import modules, define functions, and 	select the style of the figures. Users should adjust the path of the "path_datasets" to 	match the 	actual path of the folder in which the datasets are saved.



Relevant packages for our codes:
python 3.7.6
matplotlib 3.4.2
numpy 1.20.3
core_tools: 1.0
scipy 1.7.1
qcodes 0.29.0
xarray 0.20.2

For the installation of qcodes and core_tools, you can use git to clone these packages with:

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes.git
git clone https://github.com/stephanlphilips/core_tools.git

Install these packages by opening in a folder called 'Code' in  C: (as example) a Python terminal and by running the following lines:
pip install -e  ./qcodes
pip install -e  ./core_tools

To run our scripts use a software like Spyder 5.

There is a corrispondence between the name of the folders and the actual figure number in the manuscript posted on arXiv and in the published version.
This corrispondence is given by the table:

Name of Figure in the manuscript // Name of folder and script name 


Fig. 3 // Figure1


Suppl. Fig. 1 // FigureS24
Suppl. Fig. 2 // FigureS25

Suppl. Fig. 4 // FigureS18
Suppl. Fig. 5 // FigureS19 & S20
Suppl. Fig. 6 // FigureS21

Suppl. Fig. 8 // FigureS22
Suppl. Fig. 9 // FigureS17
Suppl. Fig. 10 // FigureS26
Suppl. Fig. 24 // FigureS24

Magnetic field calibration is based on CPMG experiments shown and plotted in utils/magnetic_field_calibration.
